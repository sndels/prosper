# Why disable some?
# blanket disables:
#    mostly very specific warnings, rarely actionable here
# bugprone-narrowing-conversions,cppcoreguidelines-narrowing-conversions:
#    A good warning but I'd like a debug only 'asserted cast'. TODO.
# cert-err33-c
#    Only fprintf is used for debug output
# cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers, readability-magic-numbers:
#    Requiring a named constant for a default value seems riddiculous
#    The constant would be named ~identically to the variable
# cppcoreguidelines-macro-usage:
#    Situational, for dependencies only
# cppcoreguidelines-non-private-member-variables-in-classes, misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes:
#     Having a trivial public setter is dumb.
# cppcoregoudelines-pro-bounds-*:
#    Span could be nice, but the interface is noisy at best and needs a
#    separate enumeration for index in for-auto
# cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-reinterpret-cast:
#    Arbitrary data is stored as uint8_t/unsigned char in e.g. tinygltf
# cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-union-access:
#    glm
# cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg:
#    fprintf, I really don't like formatting with streams
# misc-no-recursion
#    I do use recursion in places
# modernize-use-trailing-return-type:
#    Haven't touched professionally, best not add 'noise'
# readability-braces-around-statements:
#    clang-format and indentation makes this moot
# readability-function-cognitive-complexity:
#    Arguable false positives in scene parsing
# readability-identifier-length
#    e.g. dt for time deltas, cb for command buffer is readable enough in context
# readability-uppercase-literal-suffix:
#    Only really needed for 'l' and my font/highlighting is clear even if I use it
