- Match bokeh size between post-process and RT
- Have separate resource debug name arrays for frames in flight?
  - Is there problem with having just one array that's cleared at the start of each frame?
- Document coverage for required features/limits from gpuinfo
- Use better compression scheme for normals
- Optimize cache generation
  - Make sure ISPC is using AVX
  - Make mip gen faster if its speed is an issue
  - When low-hanging fruits have been picked, parallelize cache generation
    - Still one transfer thread
    - Split cache generation out of texture ctor
    - Run cache gen wide on the remaining threads
