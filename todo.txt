- Match bokeh size between post-process and RT
- Have separate resource debug name arrays for frames in flight?
  - Is there problem with having just one array that's cleared at the start of each frame?
- Document coverage for required features/limits from gpuinfo
- Use better compression scheme for normals
- Optimize cache generation
  - Make sure ISPC is using AVX
  - Make mip gen faster if its speed is an issue
  - When low-hanging fruits have been picked, parallelize cache generation
    - Still one transfer thread
    - Split cache generation out of texture ctor
    - Run cache gen wide on the remaining threads
- In asserted_cast do 
    else if (!std::is_same<T,V>) static_assert(!"No bounds check happen between these types");
  instead of just asserting !floatingpoint
- Span convenience ctor that takes in a single element
- Container.span() defaults to all elements
  - inference doesn't always work, could maybe be fixed on span ctor side as
    well if Span{container} is clearer than container.span()
- Rebuild TLAS every frame
  - transforms are updated each frame for raster but not for RT
- Reflect world ring layouts and descriptor writes from shader
  - consistency, less maintenance, potentially less clutter
