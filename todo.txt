- Use reflection for binding layouts
  - Have helper that compiles only ds header
    - Can we do this in a generic way that doesn't cull away the 'unused' descriptors?
- Use reflection for descriptor updates
  - Generalize like binding layout creation
- Clean up shader reflection implementation
  - At least the nested metadata parsing is messy
- Generalize binding layout creation
  - First pass will probably have sameish boilerplate in every user
