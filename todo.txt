- Match bokeh size between post-process and RT
- Have separate resource debug name arrays for frames in flight?
  - Is there problem with having just one array that's cleared at the start of each frame?
- Document coverage for required features/limits from gpuinfo
- Use better compression scheme for normals
- Optimize cache generation
  - Make sure ISPC is using AVX
  - Make mip gen faster if its speed is an issue
  - When low-hanging fruits have been picked, parallelize cache generation
    - Still one transfer thread
    - Split cache generation out of texture ctor
    - Run cache gen wide on the remaining threads
- In asserted_cast do 
    else if (!std::is_same<T,V>) static_assert(!"No bounds check happen between these types");
  instead of just asserting !floatingpoint
- Span convenience ctor that takes in a single element
- Container.span() defaults to all elements
  - inference doesn't always work, could maybe be fixed on span ctor side as
    well if Span{container} is clearer than container.span()
- Rebuild TLAS every frame
  - transforms are updated each frame for raster but not for RT
- Reflect RT/AS layout and writes from shader
  - Requires some thought for how the pNext chain and non-uniform stage flags
    within a set are handled in a generic way
- Cache frequently used device addresses
  - Address query isn't fast and is meant to be cached for repeated use
  - BLAS references
  - scratch buffer
  - TLAS instances
  - shader binding table
- Allocator debug in wheels
  - Cstdlib allocator is fine as is, should use asan/valgrind to catch issues
  - Track freed pointers?
    - Linear allocator doesn't know sizes, needs extra debug tracking
  - Fill freed memory with a known value?
    - Should run into asserts immediately if resulting values are large enough
- CS group sizes as defines, make sure same value is used in shader and
  dispatch size calc
- IBL
  - Apply the reflection adjustment from the Frostbite siggraph14 course notes
  - A Multiple-Scattering Microfacet Model for Real-Time Image-based Lighting
