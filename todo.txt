- Match bokeh size between post-process and RT
- Have separate resource debug name arrays for frames in flight?
  - Is there problem with having just one array that's cleared at the start of each frame?
- Document coverage for required features/limits from gpuinfo
- Use better compression scheme for normals
- Optimize cache generation
  - When low-hanging fruits have been picked, parallelize cache generation
    - Either convert assets in parallel or run texture compression wide one texture at a time
- In asserted_cast do 
    else if (!std::is_same<T,V>) static_assert(!"No bounds check happen between these types");
  instead of just asserting !floatingpoint
- Reflect RT/AS layout and writes from shader
  - Requires some thought for how the pNext chain and non-uniform stage flags
    within a set are handled in a generic way
- IBL
  - Apply the reflection adjustment from the Frostbite siggraph14 course notes
  - A Multiple-Scattering Microfacet Model for Real-Time Image-based Lighting
- RayTracingPass
  - RtReference and RtDirectIllumination are 90% the same code
- All passes' shaders
  - Cull unused includes
  - Then, cull unused binding sets
- Better shadow/reflection offset
  - One of the Ray Tracing Gems had a solution
- Get rid of more includes in .hpps
  - ShaderReflection
    - unique_ptr? is the indirection expensive?
    - or store reflections per shader handle in device and query each time they are used?
      more expensive?
- Per-mesh frustum culling before meshlet draw list generation
- Pipeline cache
  - https://zeux.io/2019/07/17/serializing-pipeline-cache/
- Have texture and mesh cache both next to the scene instead of textures being
  next to the textures?
