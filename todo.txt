- Docking UI, single pane for render view
  - Less fiddly alignment when adding new settings 
- Resource aliasing
  - No actual aliasing first, just reuse matching textures/buffesr
  - Reference tracking or manual mark 'unused' after last use
    - Reference tracking more involved but should be safe
      - Need some kind of framegraph to keep track of users?
    - Should support keeping references over frame boundaries
  - ResourceManager
     - hold the 'physical' resources
     - hand out the reference tracked handles for passes that write the initial data?
       - handles passed for subsequent passes
       - handle.free()?
         - No need for framegraph, subsequent use can be asserted invalid
         - Need to explicitly free after last use, extra thing to remember and
           will cause at crashes on the assert or unnecessary duplicate resources
     - allocate new resources on demand
